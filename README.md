### Description
ThreadedGraphLib is a Python library that implements a few important graph functions and search algorithms. This repo aims at building a solid understanding for various search methods using first principles of graph theory available for any datascience aspirant. It uses graphs build using python library [networks](https://networkx.org/) for all input data.
 
### Algorithm roadmap 
- Graph colouring using independednt sets 
- Maximal Vertex Cover 
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- Handshaking Lemma

### Quick start

If you want to download the latest version from github for use or development purposes, make sure that you have git and the [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installed and type the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madkaikar-ashish/threadedgraphlib.git
cd threadedgraphlib
conda env create  # Automatically creates environment based on environment.yml
conda activate threadedgraphlib # Activate the environment
pip install -e . # Install editable local version
pytest # Ensure that the test cases are running
```

The above commands create a dedicated environment so that your anaconda configuration remains clean from the required dependencies installed.
To check that everything runs fine, you can build and run a test case by typing:

### Documentation
